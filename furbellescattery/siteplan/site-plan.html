        What is a Ragdoll Cat?  

        If you're not familiar with the breed, you are in for a treat!  Ragdolls are the very finest of the feline world, inspiring limitless joy and fierce devotion in their fortunate owners. Here are some of the distinguishing features of these delightful creatures...

        Ragdolls are Affectionate!
        Ragdolls are widely considered to be the most affectionate breed of cat in the world. They crave human attention and interaction — they are known to run to greet you at the door, follow you from room to room, flop on you, sleep with you, and generally choose to be where you are. 
        The Ragdoll is the quintessential lap cat.  In fact, the breed name comes from their tendency to becomes very relaxed, and even go limp (like a ragdoll) when held in loving arms.   

        Ragdolls cats and kittens are sometimes described as “dog-like” cats because they tend to form strong bonds with their owners.  Contrary to popular belief, a man’s best friend is actually a Ragdoll cat! 


        Ragdolls are Gentle Giants
        Ragdoll cats are one of the largest breeds of domestic cat. Their peaceful demeanor, combined with their above-average size, has prompted some to call them the ‘gentle giants’ of the feline world.
        Ragdolls’ calm, loving personalities, combined with their sturdy physicality, make them ideal pets for small children, the elderly--and practically everyone else!

        Ragdolls make excellent therapy animals, and have been used in the treatment of autism, depression, anxiety disorders, and other mental illnesses. 


        Ragdolls are Smart & Playful
        But don’t let their calm demeanor fool you!  Ragdolls can be very playful and adventurous, with keen minds always active behind those blue eyes.
        The charming antics of Ragdolls kittens are legendary (just ask YouTube!), and the breed is both exceptionally intelligent and eager to please. In fact, Ragdolls cats can be trained to play fetch, walk on a leash, and even come on command. 

        With so many remarkable qualities, it is small wonder that Ragdoll owners are so fiercely loyal to the breed. 

        What is FurBelles Cattery?
        FurBelles is a home-based Ragdoll cattery that combines the love of a family with the science and skill of good breeding. Our Ragdoll kittens are bred with care in the heart of Amish country in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. With many years of cattery experience, we can offer the finest in breeding and training to our tiny Fur Belles (that's what we call our kittens).

        Our Ragdoll kittens are all exceptionally well socialized by children and other pets, meticulously groomed, and are always pampered! Never held in cages, never declawed, and never wanting for attention.

        Reservations

        The usual reservation deposit is $200 via cash or PayPal, with the rest payable when you pick up your Fur Belle. For information on available kittens, please contact us at furbelles@gmail.com.

        Adoption Process
        The FurBelles adoption process is not complicated, and we usually do not use a formal sales contract. Upon adopting your kitten, you will be provided with a receipt, a vaccination record, and a written health guarantee.
        Post-adoption, it is our privilege to provide you with lifetime cattery support. We’d love for you to keep in touch, and send of us pictures once in a while of your growing Fur Belle.

          Coloring
          FurBelles Ragdoll kittens come in many color varieties. These are some of the most common: 
          Seal Point Ragdoll – this pattern features dark brown or black “points” (on the face, ears, paws, and tail) which contrast sharply with a lighter-colored body.   
          Blue Point Ragdoll – this color scheme has blue or gray “points” instead of dark ones. 
          Mink Ragdoll / Seal Mink Ragdoll – this coveted pattern combines the darker seal points with a creamy brown “mink” coat, for a smooth, elegant appearance.  
          Tortie Point Ragdoll – this variegated pattern gives a charming mottled appearance, with splashes of color on the face and/or extremities.
          Which coloring is best?  It’s up to you!
  
          Do you prefer the striking contrasts of the seal point? The gentler tones of the blue point? Or the stylish, creamy complexion of the seal mink?  
  
          Whatever your choice, these classic color patterns—combined with their long, silky fur and gorgeous blue eyes—will make your FurBelles kitten instantly recognizable as a high-quality purebred Ragdoll.
  
  
          Registration
          CFA registration is available for select kittens for an additional fee. Registered kittens are sold under a spay/neuter contract with blue cards provided after proof of sterilization.
          Most of our litters go unregistered, since so few adopters request it. We do not sell breeding rights without extensive screening.
  
          Shipping
          Honestly, we’d rather not.  Shipping young kittens is costly and stressful (for us and the cat), and we really prefer to meet all adopters in person.
          If you absolutely must have your kitten shipped to you, please contact us—we may be able to reach an agreement.

          Fitting in with Other Pets
          Will your new kitten get along with your dog? Absolutely!
          Our kittens are extremely well-socialized, and adjust quickly to new environments and family members. They do great with children, dogs, other cats, rabbits, ferrets, guinea pigs, turtles, parakeets, hamsters, iguanas (you get the idea).
          
          
          Care and Feeding
          Ragdoll cats are easy to look after.  They need food, water, a litter box, and of course, lots of snuggles! Our kittens are fed Purina kitten chow, and are always fully weaned and litter trained at the time of adoption.
