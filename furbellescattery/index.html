        <h1>Ragdolls are Affectionate!</h1>
        <p class="text">

            Ragdolls are widely considered to be the most affectionate breed of cat in the world. They crave human attention and interaction — they are known to run to greet you at the door, follow you from room to room, flop on you, sleep with you, and generally choose to be where you are. <br><br>

            The Ragdoll is the quintessential lap cat.  In fact, the breed name comes from their tendency to becomes very relaxed, and even go limp (like a ragdoll) when held in loving arms.<br><br>   
            
            Ragdolls cats and kittens are sometimes described as “dog-like” cats because they tend to form strong bonds with their owners.  Contrary to popular belief, a man’s best friend is actually a Ragdoll cat!<br><br>

        <h1>Ragdolls are Gentle Giants</h1>
        <p class="text">
            Ragdoll cats are one of the largest breeds of domestic cat. Their peaceful demeanor, combined with their above-average size, has prompted some to call them the ‘gentle giants’ of the feline world.<br><br>

            Ragdolls’ calm, loving personalities, combined with their sturdy physicality, make them ideal pets for small children, the elderly--and practically everyone else!<br><br>

            Ragdolls make excellent therapy animals, and have been used in the treatment of autism, depression, anxiety disorders, and other mental illnesses.<br><br>

        <h1>Ragdolls are Smart & Playful</h1>
        <p class="text">
            But don’t let their calm demeanor fool you!  Ragdolls can be very playful and adventurous, with keen minds always active behind those blue eyes.<br><br>

            The charming antics of Ragdolls kittens are legendary (just ask YouTube!), and the breed is both exceptionally intelligent and eager to please. In fact, Ragdolls cats can be trained to play fetch, walk on a leash, and even come on command. <br><br>

            With so many remarkable qualities, it is small wonder that Ragdoll owners are so fiercely loyal to the breed.<br><br>
